10% time is the equivalent to 0.5 day per week if you are employed full time. of their working hours— and allows you to explore new ideas, pursue personal development, or work on projects outside their day-to-day responsibilities. This concept is part of fostering innovation, creativity, and continuous improvement within the directorate.

## What can you do in your 10% time?


The scope of what you can do with your 10% time is quite broad, allowing you to focus on activities that align with both your personal interests and the directorate’s strategic goals.

Some common uses of 10% include:

### Personal Development and Learning

You can use this time to build new skills or deepen existing ones. Whether it's [learning a new programming language](https://www.datacamp.com/courses-all?q=programming+languages&number=1&content_type=course&skill_level=Beginner) [understanding data literacy better](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-science-glossary) or enhancing your expertise in [cloud technologies](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/aws-cloud-technology-and-services), 10% time provides a space for self-study and growth.

### Explore Emerging Technologies and Tools

Stay ahead of the curve by experimenting with emerging technologies or tools that aren't part of your usual workflow. For example, you could delve into [machine learning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/understanding-machine-learning), new data visualisation platforms, or explore innovative ways to manage and analyse large datasets.


### Innovative Side Projects

10% time allows you to work on projects that might not fit into your usual responsibilities but could have a positive impact on the Ministry of Justice. This could be developing a prototype, automating a routine process, or brainstorming new methods for improving Data Analytics and Engineering.

### Contributing to Open-Source or Internal Communities

You could use your 10% time to contribute to open-source projects or build tools that benefit the broader Data and Analytics community at the Ministry of Justice. This could involve developing code libraries, improving existing data pipelines, or creating resources for others.


### Collaborate Across Teams

   It’s also an opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in other areas of the directorate or even across the Ministry. You might work with others on a shared problem, develop cross-functional tools, or exchange knowledge and best practices.


### Participate in Hackathons and Firebreaks

You can also engage in activities like hackathons: recently, we developed a [python package](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/mojap-metadata) that allows users to read and alter our metadata schemas. You can download the files [here](https://pypi.org/project/mojap-metadata/)

You can join our firebreaks, where teams come together to tackle a specific challenge over a short period. These events encourage creativity, problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration, and 10% time can support your participation.

The flexibility of 10% time ensures that it can be used in ways that align with both your individual career aspirations and the broader innovation goals of the Data and Analytics Directorate at the Ministry of Justice.
