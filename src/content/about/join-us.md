## Questions about our current recruitment

### Where are the roles based?

The roles are national. We have a number of offices around the England and Wales. See this link to find your closest one ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1CsJxWFinu4iFbA0Tnq-KrwUAkbvLOZwQ&ll=52.93989869394286%2C-3.20735400000002&z=7)

We're open to flexible and hybrid working arrangements that include regular home working, but you'll need to go to one of these offices from time to time. 

### What kind of people are you looking for for these roles?

We are really keen to break away from the archetypal views of a Data Engineer and Analytics Engineer. We really encourage anyone with the relevant skills and willingness to learn to apply. We will support you to learn skills you may not yet had the opportunity to learn, but show an eagerness to. 

### Sounds good, but I still have some questions. Where can I ask them?

Weâ€™ve setup a mailbox at ðŸ‘‰ dmet-dataplatform-recruitment@digital.justice.gov.uk for any questions. 

And of course, thereâ€™s always the webinar too ðŸ‘‰ [sign up here](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/a1df44e8-cf15-438e-acea-d3834f0de585@c6874728-71e6-41fe-a9e1-2e8c36776ad8)
