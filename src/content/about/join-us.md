# Onboarding

After they have received their offer to join us, all data engineers and analytics engineers are provided with a bespoke onboarding task board. This includes all the tasks you need to be fully onboarded to the Ministry of Justice; even tasks before your first day. Many of these initial tasks are completed by your line manager, but we aim to provide as much transparency as possible so that you feel at ease before your first day with us.

Over the first few weeks and months of the role, new starters are then provided the hardware, software and access required for their role. There is training to bring you up to speed on the tools and systems we use, as well as dedicated time to meet your colleagues and senior members of staff, so you can get to know the wider work that the Ministry of Justice uses. If you're new to the civil service, there will also be sessions to understand what being a civil servant means, in addition to learning about your pension, policies and what support you can get.

Onboarding doesn't stop there though, as throughout their time at the Ministry of Justice, data engineers and analytics engineers are supported to develop new skills and abilities required for their profession.
