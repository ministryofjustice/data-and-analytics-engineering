Successful candidates will join the Data Modelling and Engineering Team (DMET), but will also collaborate closely with the Data Platform team. To learn more about our team structure, please visit our [Team Structure](../structure/) page.

For more details about the roles of data and analytics engineers, please visit our [About](../) page. To find out more about our technology stack, tools, and services, check out the [Architecture](../architecture/) page.

Additionally, we are hosting a webinar for these positions on Monday, September 2nd, 6-7PM ([sign up link here](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/a1df44e8-cf15-438e-acea-d3834f0de585@c6874728-71e6-41fe-a9e1-2e8c36776ad8)). During this event, we'll cover:

- The role of data and analytics engineering within the MoJ, our philosophy on data provision, and the analytical teams we support
- How to apply for positions within the Civil Service, including tips for a successful application

This webinar will also provide an opportunity to ask questions about the roles. In the meantime, we've posted answers to frequently asked questions below.

## Questions about our current recruitment

### Where are the roles based?

The roles are national. We have a number of offices around the England and Wales. See this link to find your closest one ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1CsJxWFinu4iFbA0Tnq-KrwUAkbvLOZwQ&ll=52.93989869394286%2C-3.20735400000002&z=7)

We're open to flexible and hybrid working arrangements that include regular home working, but you'll need to go to one of these offices from time to time. 

### What kind of people are you looking for for these roles?

We are really keen to break away from the archetypal views of a data engineer and analytics engineer. We really encourage anyone with the relevant skills and willingness to learn to apply. We will support you to learn skills you may not yet had the opportunity to learn, but show an eagerness to. 

### Sounds good, but I still have some questions. Where can I ask them?

Weâ€™ve setup a mailbox at ðŸ‘‰ dmet-dataplatform-recruitment@digital.justice.gov.uk for any questions. 

And of course, thereâ€™s always the webinar too ðŸ‘‰ [sign up here](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/a1df44e8-cf15-438e-acea-d3834f0de585@c6874728-71e6-41fe-a9e1-2e8c36776ad8)
