# Pre-employment checks

Successful candidates will have to complete a series of [pre-employment checks](https://justicejobs.tal.net/vx/candidate/cms/Recruitment%20and%20Selection%20Process) before they can begin work at the Ministry of Justice. Currently, all data engineers will require a minimum security clearance level of SC, which is above the Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks. [Visit this link](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels) for more information about UK Government security checks.

# Onboarding

After pre-employment checks have been completed, candidates are provided with a bespoke onboarding task board. This includes all the tasks candidates need to be fully setup as a data engineer or analytics engineer at the Ministry of Justice. Many of the initial pre-first day tasks are completed by the candidates line manager, but we aim to provide as much transparency as possible so that they feel at ease before their first day with us.

Over the first few weeks and months of the role, new starters are then provided the hardware, software and access required for their role. We provide training to bring them up to speed on the tools and systems we use, as well as pre-scheduled meetings to meet colleagues and senior members of staff, so you new starters get to know the wider work that the Ministry of Justice does. If new to the civil service, there will also be sessions to understand what being a civil servant means, in addition to learning about civil service pension, policies and support on offer.

Onboarding doesn't stop there though, as throughout their time at the Ministry of Justice, data engineers and analytics engineers are supported to develop new skills and abilities required for their profession. Check out our page on [Learning and Development](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering/handbook/learning-and-development/) to find out more.
