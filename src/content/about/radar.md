## Data and Analytics Engineering Tech Radar

The MoJ [Data and Analytics Engineering community](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering/) maintains a [public Tech Radar](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering-tech-radar/) that is refreshed annually in August to help align technology choices within our teams. Our Tech Radar is based on [pioneering work by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and uses Zalando's JavaScript Library [radar.js](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar/blob/master/docs/radar.js) with [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org/) for visualisation.


Tech radar blips are configured in *blips.json*, while tech radar rings and quadrants are set up in *radar_config.json*. Additional context for the blips is provided by GitHub discussions, which are queried using the GitHub GraphQL API to populate *blips.json*. See [manage_discussions](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/data-and-analytics-engineering-tech-radar/blob/main/manage_discussions/README.md) for how we do this.

### Aim of a Tech Radar
By bringing together the collective expertise of our engineers, we aim to:


* Ensure our teams are on the same page regarding tools and technologies.
* Keep up with emerging trends and assess their potential impact.
* Encourage knowledge sharing across teams.
* Reflect our collective input in GitHub Discussions for an accurate Tech Radar annual refresh.

Inspired by the pioneering work of [ThoughtWorks](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar), our [Tech Radar](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering-tech-radar/) provides a snapshot of tools, techniques, platforms, languages, and frameworks relevant to our teams at a specific point in time.
