We operate matrix management within the data and analytics engineering professions.

Under matrix management, you report to multiple people. You will have one [people manager](people-management/) and one or more [work managers](work-management/), depending on the structure of the team you’re working in. Your people manager and work manager will normally be different but may be the same in some circumstances. This is more likely for analytics engineers, due to the smaller size of the profession.

Your people manager will normally stay the same as you move roles, projects and teams, whereas your work manager will change.

Matrix management provides several benefits:

- you can seek advice from more than one person and get different perspectives on a problem
- you can take a longer-term perspective on career planning, progression and development because your people manager will stay the same
- your people manager can advocate for you and make sure you’re getting what you need from your role
- you can learn more about what is happening in other teams and identify opportunities for collaboration
- people management responsibilities can be balanced more evenly across the professions, despite any differences in team size
