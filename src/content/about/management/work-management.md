A work manager is responsible for directing the day-to-day work of the people they manage.

## Responsibilities

As a work manager, you would be expected to:

- assign tickets to the people you manage and support them, where required, to complete them
- work with the people you manage to agree and monitor goals and objectives, in collaboration with their people manager

## Meetings

As a work manager, you will meet with the people you are managing several times a week if not every day. This will typically be at team meetings and ceremonies, such as stand-ups.

You may not need to have one-to-one meetings with the people you manage but you should be led by them.
