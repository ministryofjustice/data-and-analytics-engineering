## Domain Alignment

Teams in Data and Analytics Engineering are domain-aligned to facilitate collaboration with stakeholders and the transition from heritage systems to new services.

To find out more about each domain please access the links below. Please note that some links are internal to MoJ.

- [Probation and Risk](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/dmet-probation) is responsible for providing access to the following raw and transformed data from heritage sources [Delius](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/8dae5fb2-82a2-4232-ae79-87e9c9fcfe46/ndelius) (The National Probation Serviceâ€™s Case Management System) and [OASys](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/911acd3c-495f-48ca-88b6-024210868b06/offender-assessment-system-oasys) (Used to assess the risks and needs of eligible offenders in prisons and probation trusts). In addition it is also responsible for providing data from a number of probation-digital services.
