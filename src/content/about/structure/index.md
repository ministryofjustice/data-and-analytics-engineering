# Team Structure

Data and analytics engineers in the MoJ work across various teams:

- The Analytical Platform team, which maintains the MoJ [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#content).
- The Data Catalogue team, which maintains the MoJ [Data Catalogue](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#content).
- The Data Modelling and Engineering team (DMET), which delivers solutions to internal stakeholder needs across the MoJ.

Data and analytics engineers belong to the same Data directorate, as summarised in this diagram:

## Data Modeling Engineering Team (DMET)

DMET is divided into multiple portfolio teams, each with a specific focus. The domain-led teams work closely with data providers and consumers from specific domains to understand their requirements and ensure their needs are met. Meanwhile, the cross-functional teams collaborate across team boundaries to promote best practices and maintain alignment.
