## DMET

DMET is divided into multiple portfolio teams, each with a specific focus. The domain-led teams work closely with data providers and consumers from specific domains to understand their requirements and ensure their needs are met. Meanwhile, the cross-functional teams collaborate across team boundaries to promote best practices and maintain alignment.
