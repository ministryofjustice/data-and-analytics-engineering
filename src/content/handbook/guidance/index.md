## Analytical Platform

The Analytical Platform (AP) is a data analysis platform made up of tools, packages and datasets for creating applications that utilise data within the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The AP provides development environments in both Python (JupyterLab) and R (RStudio), allowing you multiple ways to query, analyse and model data.

## Cloud Platform

The Ministry of Justiceâ€™s Cloud Platform is a modern, cloud-native hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice. The Cloud Platform provides a way for teams to: (1) deploy a service or application into the cloud; (2) utilise common tooling, such as monitoring, logging, alerting, and security scanning of container images, without teams needing to configure or manage the infrastructure; (3) implement zero downtime deploys, scalability, and high availability of services.
