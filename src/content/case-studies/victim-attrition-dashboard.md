# Cross-CJS: Victim Attrition Dashboard

## Overview
A collaborative project linking data across the Criminal Justice System (Police, CPS, MoJ) to track victim journeys and support the development of policies that reduce attrition and improve outcomes.

## Challenge
- Victim-related data was fragmented across agencies
- No complete view of case journeys or where victims disengage
- Difficult to support Victims’ Code implementation with data

## Solution
- Linked datasets from Police, CPS, and MoJ into a single analytical asset
- Built an interactive dashboard with Sankey diagrams and offence-level breakdowns
- Enabled secure, governed data sharing for analysts and policy teams

## Impact
- Supported Victims’ Code consultation and upcoming policy decisions
- Empowered analysts with end-to-end visibility of the justice process
- Generated insights into timelines, attrition points, and regional differences

## Tools & Technologies
- Linked cross-agency datasets
- Interactive visualisations (Sankey, offence filters)
- Secure data governance controls

## Partners
- MoJ Analysts
- Crown Prosecution Service
- Police Data Teams
- Home Office
