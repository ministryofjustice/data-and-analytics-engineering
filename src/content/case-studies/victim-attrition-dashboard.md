## Overview

The Victim Attrition Dashboard was developed to provide end-to-end visibility of victim experiences within the Criminal Justice System (CJS). By linking data from the Police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and MoJ, the dashboard helps policy teams and operational users identify key points where victims disengage, enabling more targeted interventions.

## Challenge

Data relating to victims was previously disconnected and hard to access. Without a joined-up view across Police, CPS, and court stages, it was difficult to understand where attrition occurred or how victim engagement could be improved. Policy teams and analysts lacked the tools to explore trends across stages or assess the effectiveness of different services.

## Solution

We created a secure, linked dataset that follows cases and victims through the justice processâ€”from reporting and charging through to trial and resolution. This data was surfaced in an interactive dashboard that includes breakdowns by offence type, region, and victim characteristics. A dynamic Sankey diagram illustrates victim flow through CJS stages and highlights where attrition occurs.

The solution was developed with governance in mind, ensuring data remained protected and shared appropriately across agencies.

## Impact

The dashboard has empowered MoJ, CPS, and Home Office colleagues to better understand victim outcomes. It directly supported the consultation on the Victims and Prisoners Act 2024 and is informing policy and service development. It also enables earlier and more tailored interventions by surfacing gaps in support and common disengagement patterns.

## Tools & Technologies

We used linked data pipelines, interactive visualisation libraries, and secure data governance frameworks. The dashboard supports filtering and drill-downs to allow users to tailor their analysis.

## Partners

This work was delivered collaboratively by MoJ analysts, the CPS, Police data teams, and the Home Office, with support from data engineering and governance colleagues.
