- A pioneering approach to cross-account data access enabled secure, seamless integration

## Impact
- Enhanced data transparency and consistency for end users
- Continued provision of essential data for policy and operational analysis
- Streamlined data access improves the departmentâ€™s ability to respond to emerging priorities

## Tools & Technologies
- Cross-account data access controls
- Automated reporting pipelines

## Partners
