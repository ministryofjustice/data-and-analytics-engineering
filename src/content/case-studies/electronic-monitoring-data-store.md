## Overview
The Electronic Monitoring (EM) Data Store delivers higher-quality data and enables a step change in how EM data is accessed, linked, and analysed. It supports better service performance, policy insight, and operational use.

## Challenge
- Previous EM data was fragmented, manual, and low-volume
- End users could not generate insights or track key outcomes effectively

## Solution
- Created a new, centralised EM data store with better data quality and volume
- Developed new data feeds with richer attributes and improved accessibility
- Designed for compatibility with other probation and prison data systems

## Impact
- Reduced reoffending through improved monitoring and targeted breach notifications
- Improved access for probation officers and justice system partners
- Strengthened the evidence base for the use of EM

## Tools & Technologies
- Secure data pipelines and feeds
- Linked datasets across justice domains

## Partners
- HMPPS
- Probation Service
- Data Engineering teams

## Related Projects or Next Steps
- Expanding links to housing, sentencing, and service outcomes
- Ongoing enhancements to support innovation and AI use in justice
