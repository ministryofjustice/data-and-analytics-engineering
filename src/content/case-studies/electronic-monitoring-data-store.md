## Overview

The Electronic Monitoring (EM) Data Store project delivered a new, centralised data platform for electronic monitoring data, improving its quality, coverage, and accessibility. This enabled deeper analysis of how EM is used, supported better service performance, and improved the evidence base for reducing reoffending.

## Challenge

The existing EM data feeds were fragmented and manually managed, limiting their usefulness for analysis and operational decision-making. The data available lacked depth and consistency, making it difficult for end users to generate meaningful insights or understand the effectiveness of EM interventions.

## Solution

We designed and implemented a new EM Data Store based on modern architecture principles. This store aggregates richer, more comprehensive datasets and provides a reliable, auditable route for accessing both raw and transformed data.

The new solution was designed to work in parallel with prisons and probation data models, enabling cross-service analysis and providing continuity as underlying systems evolve. The platform also supports the automation of data feeds, ensuring timely access to information.

## Impact

The EM Data Store has significantly improved data quality and usability, enabling better insight into how EM is used in practice. Probation teams can now access data that supports more accurate breach notifications, targeted interventions, and evidence-based decisions. The enhanced data structure also supports innovation, including the integration of AI tools to drive further service improvement.

## Tools & Technologies

The platform uses automated pipelines and a centralised, standardised design to support data curation, access, and transformation.

## Partners

This project was delivered in collaboration with HMPPS, the Probation Service, and the MoJ Data Engineering and Analytics teams.
