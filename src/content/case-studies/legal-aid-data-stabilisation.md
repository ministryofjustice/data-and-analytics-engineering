# Legal Aid Data Stabilisation

## Overview
This initiative supports the transition from legacy systems to a modernised Legal Aid data landscape. It introduces a stable and governed model that serves both operational and analytical needs.

## Challenge
- Multiple bespoke analytical solutions created duplication and lacked documentation
- Legacy systems were difficult to integrate with new digital services
- Governance, security, and performance were limited

## Solution
- Built a central data layer combining legacy and new data
- Developed a dimensional model optimised for both analytics and operations
- Enabled seamless integration with new systems (e.g. Civil Apply)

## Impact
- Reduced cost of service through rationalised infrastructure
- Improved data access and consistency for LAA analysts
- Enabled scalable, governed analytics for digital transformation

## Tools & Technologies
- Dimensional modelling
- Reverse ETL
- Secure, modern cloud-based pipelines

## Partners
- Legal Aid Agency (LAA)
- LAA Digital and Data Management
- MoJ Finance and Statistics users
