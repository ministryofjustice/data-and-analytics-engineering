# User-Centric Design of Services (Tribunals)

## Overview
The CFT team worked with tribunals users to co-design data services that are scalable, intuitive, and focused on impact. The aim is to modernise how justice data is accessed and used.

## Challenge
- Heritage systems delivered inconsistent, hard-to-use data
- Stakeholders lacked visibility on business impact and feasibility of data needs
- Poor user experience hindered data-driven decision making

## Solution
- Established a shared roadmap with users to align needs and capabilities
- Streamlined data access and reduced technical failures
- Prioritised access to trusted data and clear visualisations

## Impact
- Enabled consistent and timely justice data access
- Reduced pipeline memory usage 10â€“50x
- Promoted organisational effectiveness through modern modelling

## Tools & Technologies
- Scalable pipeline design
- Consistent modelling frameworks

## Partners
- Civil, Family, and Tribunals (CFT) team
- HMCTS stakeholders
- MoJ analysts
