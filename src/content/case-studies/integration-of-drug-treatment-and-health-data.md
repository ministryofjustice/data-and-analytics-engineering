## Overview

This initiative enabled the integration of justice system data with health and drug treatment datasets, creating a joined-up evidence base to support rehabilitation services and policy development. It provides insight into how substance misuse interventions intersect with justice outcomes and helps target support where it’s most needed.

## Challenge

People involved in the criminal justice system often experience complex, overlapping challenges—including substance misuse, mental health issues, and housing insecurity. However, the data needed to understand these factors was spread across departments, with limited mechanisms for linking it securely and effectively.

Without integration between justice and health datasets, policymakers and service providers lacked a clear picture of what interventions work, when, and for whom.

## Solution

Building on the BOLD programme’s infrastructure, we linked MoJ datasets with drug treatment data from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (now DLUHC). This enabled analysis of pathways through community sentences, custodial sentences, and health-based treatment orders.

The data linkage allowed teams to track whether individuals received treatment, how it related to justice outcomes, and whether service access improved over time. It was structured to support both operational analysis and academic research.

## Impact

The linked data supported service improvement in areas such as Community Sentence Treatment Requirements (CSTRs) and prison-to-community transitions. It informed multi-agency planning and policy development on rehabilitation and reoffending.

By quantifying outcomes and enabling better targeting of interventions, the project helped lay the groundwork for integrated health and justice strategies. It also demonstrated how data sharing can improve support for vulnerable groups without compromising privacy or trust.

## Tools & Technologies

We used de-identified data pipelines, secure cross-government data sharing agreements, and robust linkage logic. The outputs were designed for analysis in trusted research environments.

## Partners

This work was delivered by MoJ data teams in collaboration with DHSC, DLUHC, treatment service providers, and operational policy leads across the justice system.
