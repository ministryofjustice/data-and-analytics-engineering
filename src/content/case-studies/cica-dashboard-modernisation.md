## Overview

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) modernised its management information systems by introducing an automated, interactive dashboard. This transformation reduced dependency on legacy systems and manual reporting, while improving user experience and access to key data insights.

## Challenge

CICA’s reporting processes relied heavily on manual Excel-based workflows and an external supplier-managed legacy system. Access to data was limited to a small number of users, creating a bottleneck for insight generation and decision making. The system lacked flexibility, and users were unable to explore key performance indicators (KPIs) independently.

## Solution

We developed a new dashboard and deployed it on the MoJ Cloud Platform. The dashboard includes intuitive navigation, drill-down capability, and clear visualisations of key metrics. Data is refreshed automatically and provided in a pre-processed format, enabling self-service analysis without impacting source systems.

By consolidating KPIs and providing a simple, secure interface, the dashboard empowers users across CICA to make informed decisions based on real-time operational data.

## Impact

The new solution delivered savings by replacing the legacy systems. It significantly improved access to data across the organisation and removed the dependency on a single gatekeeper for reporting. Users are now able to explore data directly, identify inefficiencies, and track claims throughout their lifecycle.

The dashboard also laid the groundwork for a stronger data culture at CICA, with clearer visibility of operational performance and increased confidence in metrics.

## Tools & Technologies

We used cloud-based data pipelines and dashboarding tools to create an automated, interactive interface. The dashboard supports filtering, drill-downs, and secure access controls to ensure data integrity and user autonomy.

## Partners

This work was delivered by MoJ Data Engineering in collaboration with CICA Operations and Commercial Analysts.
