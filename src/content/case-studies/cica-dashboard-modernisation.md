# CICA Dashboard Modernisation

## Overview
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) modernised its management information systems by introducing an automated, interactive dashboard, reducing dependency on legacy systems and manual reporting.

## Challenge

- Enabled drill-down capability, KPI tracking, and intuitive data visualisation
- Provided direct, self-service access to pre-processed data

## Impact
- Annual saving from retiring legacy systems
- Greater independence for users to make data-driven decisions
- Reduced pressure on source systems and analysts

## Tools & Technologies
- Cloud-based dashboarding tools
- Pre-processed datasets with automated refresh

## Partners
