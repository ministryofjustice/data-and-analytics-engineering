## Overview

The One Crown project aligned multiple data sources across the criminal courts into a single, consistent dataset. This trusted dataset supports seamless access for analysis, forecasting, and modelling—helping the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) make better, faster decisions.

## Challenge

Data in the criminal justice system was spread across disparate systems with inconsistent definitions and update frequencies. These issues caused delays in reporting, misalignment across departments, and limited the ability of analysts to generate reliable insights. The absence of a unified data model hindered forecasting, performance monitoring, and policy evaluation.

## Solution

We designed a modern, scalable data model – the OneCrown dataset – that integrates key criminal court data from multiple sources. This model supports a wide range of analytical and operational use cases, and was built using shared data definitions agreed between HMCTS and MoJ.

The team adopted a collaborative approach, working with users to understand business needs and with technical teams to ensure consistent implementation. The OneCrown model forms part of a broader vision to create unified data models across all court jurisdictions.

## Impact

The new dataset enables faster and more confident decision making. It improves consistency between operational dashboards, published statistics, and internal reports. It also supports performance monitoring across the criminal courts, helping reduce case backlogs and enabling better resource planning.

## Tools & Technologies

We used a modern data architecture and delivery framework based on shared standards, collaborative design, and cloud-based infrastructure.

## Partners

The project was delivered jointly by MoJ Data and Analysis teams, HMCTS stakeholders, and the Civil, Family and Tribunals (CFT) engineering team.
