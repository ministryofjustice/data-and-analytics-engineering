## Overview

The Data First Programme enables secure access to linked, de-identified justice datasets for research and policy analysis. By improving data quality, consistency, and usability, the programme supports evidence-based decision making across the justice system and academic sector.

## Challenge

Justice system data is often fragmented across organisations and not easily accessible to researchers. Data quality and formatting inconsistencies made it difficult to link datasets, while limited infrastructure and governance frameworks constrained sharing and reuse. Analysts and researchers needed a scalable way to access well-documented, high-quality data that could support robust statistical and social research.

## Solution

The programme created analytics-ready and research-ready data products based on securely linked datasets. These products were made accessible through trusted research environments such as the ONS Secure Research Service and the SAIL Databank. The team also worked with the Turing Institute and academic partners to develop synthetic data tools, improve pipeline quality, and simplify data structures.

A key focus was modernising the underlying pipeline architecture, introducing features such as embedded Splink identifiers, de-identified linkage mechanisms, and clearer data documentation. This allowed for greater transparency and easier integration with other MoJ data assets.

## Impact

The programme has enabled over 50 research projects, supporting both in-house analysis and external academic collaboration. It received the 2024 Collaboration Award at the Analysis in Government Awards for its contributions to justice policy, transparency, and public value. Outputs have informed publications, improved justice services, and supported interdisciplinary learning.

## Tools & Technologies

The programme delivered structured, modelled datasets, pipeline-integrated linking tools, and synthetic data generators. These were integrated into secure research environments with rigorous governance processes.

## Partners

Data First was delivered by MoJâ€™s Data and Analytics teams in collaboration with academic researchers, the Turing Institute, ADR UK, and platform providers including ONS and SAIL.
