## Overview

This workstream focused on improving the quality, consistency, and usability of data across civil, family, and tribunal services. By building responsive, integrated dashboards and reporting pipelines, the project helped deliver faster access to critical insights and support data-driven decision making across the justice system.

## Challenge

Data across civil, family, and tribunal jurisdictions was historically inconsistent and difficult to access. Changes in data collection systems and evolving policy priorities made it hard to track performance and understand service outcomes. Operational teams needed clear, reliable dashboards to monitor trends, support front-line staff, and meet reporting obligations.

## Solution

We worked with service teams to identify common requirements and built unified reporting tools that draw on standardised data pipelines. This included dashboards such as SDS+ (supporting safe decision making on early release) and the Safety Diagnostic Tool (providing front-line prison staff with timely safety indicators).

We implemented flexible data models that adapt to shifting policy contexts and enabled drill-down views that support both operational and strategic use. The design approach emphasised user experience and transparency, allowing non-specialist users to explore data confidently.

## Impact

The dashboards improved access to data for both operational and analytical users. For example, SDS+ helped ensure that key safety, risk, and policy metrics were available in real time to inform early release decisions. The Safety Diagnostic Tool provided front-line staff with insights into incidents and trends, improving the ability to identify and respond to risks.

Across civil, family, and tribunal services, the improvements reduced duplication, improved trust in data, and enabled more informed decisions at every level of the system.

## Tools & Technologies

We used modern dashboarding frameworks integrated with reusable data models, hosted securely via the MoJ Cloud Platform. The tools supported filtering, trend analysis, and tailored reporting views.

## Partners

This work was delivered in partnership with the CFT (Civil, Family and Tribunals) data team, operational leads, analysts, and policy stakeholders across HMCTS and MoJ.
