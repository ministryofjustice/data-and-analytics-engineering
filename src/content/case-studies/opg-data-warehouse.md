# OPG Data Warehouse

## Overview
The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) developed a centralised data warehouse to bring together scattered data sources and embed consistent logic into reporting and performance monitoring.

## Challenge
- OPG data was stored in disparate formats, lacking integration
- Inconsistent business logic led to conflicting reports
- Difficult for analysts to access and reuse data

## Solution
- Reviewed existing code and business logic in R, Python, and SQL
- Produced a conformed data model integrating key metrics
- Enabled multiple reporting outputs from a single data source

## Impact
- Consistent, auditable reports across OPG and MoJ
- Improved quality and availability of data for the LPA dashboard
- Enabled better decision-making and customer service improvements

## Tools & Technologies
- Centralised data warehouse
- Conformed data modelling
- Integrated reporting pipelines

## Partners
- OPG Data Science
- MoJ Data Engineering
- LPA Dashboard Team
