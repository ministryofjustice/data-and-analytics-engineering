## Overview

The Offender Risk Assessment Data Sharing initiative enabled the secure integration and modelling of offender data to improve risk assessment and public protection. It supported both internal MoJ users and external researchers with high-quality, analytics-ready data that informs decisions around managing offending behaviour and reducing harm.

## Challenge

Information relevant to offender risk was distributed across multiple systems, with no standard process for combining or analysing the data. Risk assessment models needed more comprehensive inputs, but linking sensitive data raised privacy, governance, and infrastructure challenges. Analysts and researchers required data that was secure, well-documented, and suitable for statistical modelling.

## Solution

We produced an analytics-ready, modelled dataset that combines key indicators of offender behaviour and system interactions. This was complemented by a research-ready data product, shared through trusted research environments such as the ONS Secure Research Service. We embedded these outputs in a governance framework and provided summaries of data quality and structure to support interpretation and reuse.

The solution supported the development of a new publication: “A Profile of Repeat Offending by Children and Young People in England and Wales,” which used the new dataset to generate novel insight into youth offending patterns.

## Impact

The project enabled MoJ analysts and accredited researchers to explore repeat offending in greater detail and to inform evidence-based policy and service delivery. It improved collaboration between data engineering, research, and academic engagement teams and demonstrated a scalable model for secure, high-value data sharing in the justice context.

## Tools & Technologies

We used the Create a Derived Table (CaDeT) service to decouple dataset production from the core data linking infrastructure, improving modularity and enabling greater reuse. Linked identifiers and synthetic data tooling supported privacy-preserving analysis and research proposal development.

## Partners

This work was delivered by MoJ Data Engineers, the Research, Academic Engagement and Communications teams, and the ONS Secure Research Service. The resulting data products were used by both internal MoJ teams and academic researchers.
