## Overview

The Gold Scorecard Dashboard is the Ministry of Justice’s primary mechanism for monitoring the performance of high-value contracts. By automating the integration of procurement data from multiple systems, the project improved visibility, reduced duplication, and strengthened the evidence base for commercial decisions.

## Challenge

Commercial teams were spending significant time manually collecting and reconciling data from multiple contract management systems, including Jaggaer and RIO. This introduced inefficiencies, increased the risk of human error, and limited the frequency and accuracy of reporting on contract performance—particularly for the department’s most valuable contracts.

## Solution

We built automated data pipelines that extract, transform, and load contract performance data from multiple commercial systems into a central data model. The resulting dataset powers the Gold Scorecard Dashboard, which provides a unified view of contract performance across MoJ’s commercial portfolio.

The dashboard allows users to explore data by contract, supplier, SBO, or contractor. It includes features such as summary statistics, downloadable source data, and historic trend views, enabling users to understand performance and intervene early where needed.

## Impact

The automated solution reduced the manual burden on commercial staff and eliminated the risk of inconsistent data entry. It improved transparency and enabled more frequent and reliable performance monitoring. This enhanced the MoJ’s ability to manage its commercial risk and improve outcomes across the department’s £20 billion spend under management.

## Tools & Technologies

We used modern data engineering practices to integrate data from Jaggaer, RIO, and other systems. The dashboard was built using cloud-based tools that support interactivity, historic views, and user-defined filters.

## Partners

This work was delivered by the MoJ Data Engineering and Commercial Analytics teams, in collaboration with procurement professionals across the department.
