## Overview

The Better Outcomes through Linked Data (BOLD) programme improves outcomes across the Criminal Justice System by linking data from multiple government departments. This secure, cross-government data sharing initiative enables richer analysis and more coordinated decision-making to support vulnerable groups and deliver better public services.

## Challenge

Data about people and events in the justice system was previously siloed across agencies such as the Police, HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS), and the Department for Education (DfE). Without linked data, it was difficult to understand full case journeys, evaluate outcomes, or design effective interventions. The lack of integration also limited the ability of analysts and policymakers to identify systemic issues or measure impact across departmental boundaries.

## Solution

The BOLD programme developed a secure, governed framework for linking datasets across government. It enabled new data flows between agencies including Essex Police, HMPPS, DfE, and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). Specific use cases included linking learning records with prison data, connecting homelessness data with probation records, and developing dashboards to track victim journeys across the Criminal Justice System.

The team also tested a cost-benefit analysis approach across two pilots – one focused on policy, and the other on operational improvement. These pilots helped quantify the benefits of investing in data improvement work.

## Impact

BOLD won “Initiative of the Year” at the British Data Awards, recognising its cross-sector impact. It demonstrated that for every £1 invested, £1.20 in benefits could be returned, with break-even expected within two to three years. The linked datasets enabled novel insights into reoffending, homelessness, and service effectiveness, while dashboards provided operational teams with up-to-date information to inform casework and strategy.

## Tools & Technologies

The programme used secure SFTP data transfers, de-identified data modelling, and cloud-based dashboards with dynamic visualisations (including Sankey diagrams) to support exploration of justice pathways.

## Partners

This work was delivered collaboratively with Essex Police, HMPPS, DfE, DLUHC, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and research partners including the SAIL Databank and ADR UK.
