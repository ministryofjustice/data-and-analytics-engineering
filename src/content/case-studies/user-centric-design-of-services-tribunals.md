## Overview

This project focused on designing scalable and intuitive data services for tribunals, with user needs at the centre of every design decision. By working closely with data consumers across MoJ and HMCTS, the team ensured that new tools supported real-world tasks, improved data access, and enhanced justice outcomes.

## Challenge

Tribunal data systems had evolved from heritage platforms with fragmented structures and limited flexibility. Users often struggled to access consistent, timely data. Analytical processes were inefficient, and it was difficult to trace how requests translated into product development or operational improvement.

## Solution

The Civil, Family and Tribunals (CFT) team co-designed a roadmap with users to understand their data needs and prioritise delivery accordingly. They simplified and stabilised data pipelines, significantly reducing memory usage and improving reliability. By applying clear modelling standards and engaging regularly with end users, the team ensured that data services were meaningful, consistent, and usable.

A single framework was used to develop data models that serve multiple jurisdictions, reducing duplication and supporting long-term sustainability.

## Impact

The redesigned data services improved the consistency and availability of justice data for tribunal users. Technical reliability improved dramatically, with memory usage in pipelines reduced by 10 to 50 times. Stakeholders gained better visibility into data development, helping them make more informed decisions and track impact.

The work also laid the groundwork for expanded data access and modernisation across civil, family, and tribunals services, strengthening access to justice.

## Tools & Technologies

We used standardised modelling techniques and scalable data architecture to deliver reliable, user-aligned products.

## Partners

This project was delivered by the CFT data engineering team in partnership with analysts and operational leads across HMCTS and MoJ.
