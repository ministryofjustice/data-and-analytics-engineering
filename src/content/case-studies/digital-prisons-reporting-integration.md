## Overview

The Digital Prisons Reporting Integration project enhanced the transparency, consistency, and accessibility of data used to monitor the prison system. By modernising how data is collected and shared, the project enabled better operational planning, public reporting, and analysis of prison policy impacts.

## Challenge

Prison data was historically managed through monolithic, fragmented systems, which limited consistency and made data hard to access or interpret. Rapid policy changes and increasing operational pressures placed greater demand on analysts and end users, who needed timely and reliable information to monitor prison capacity and service delivery.

## Solution

We developed a unified data reporting layer in collaboration with the Digital Prisons Reporting team. This layer integrated multiple data sources into a single automated pipeline, replacing manual processes with a streamlined, responsive system. The team also introduced a pioneering cross-account data access model to ensure secure, scalable integration.

The approach supported real-time policy analysis and operational insight—particularly for areas such as the early release scheme (SDS+) and prison population modelling—where rapid data updates are critical.

## Impact

The integration improved the reliability and usability of prison data across the MoJ. It enabled ongoing support for safety monitoring tools, operational dashboards, and policy analysis. Analysts can now access consistent, up-to-date datasets, reducing duplicated effort and improving decision-making speed and confidence.

## Tools & Technologies

We used automated cloud-based pipelines and cross-account access controls to enable secure and scalable data integration.

## Partners

This work was delivered jointly by the Data and Analytics Engineering team and the Digital Prisons Reporting team. It supported users across HMPPS, MoJ policy and analysis functions, and public reporting audiences.
