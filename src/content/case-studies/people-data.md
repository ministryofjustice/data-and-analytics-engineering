## Overview

The People Data Platform project was designed to improve how people data is accessed and used across the Ministry of Justice. It enables analysts to answer complex questions about recruitment, staff wellbeing, and workforce planning using clean, modelled data built on a modern technology stack.

## Challenge

Historically, people data was fragmented, inconsistently recorded, and difficult to use. Analysts spent significant time cleaning and interpreting data from multiple sources, and there was no central model that brought together information on staffing, organisational structure, recruitment, or wellbeing. These challenges made it harder to deliver insight, particularly when responding to strategic or cross-cutting workforce questions.

## Solution

We created a unified data model that combines a range of HR-related datasetsâ€”such as staff in post, recruitment pipelines, and organisational structure. This model was built using robust pipelines and best-in-class tooling to ensure data was clean, timely, and accessible.

The platform supports both descriptive and predictive analysis, enabling teams to explore workforce trends, support strategic decision making, and unlock AI-powered use cases. By structuring data to serve multiple domains, the solution allows analysts across the MoJ to reuse core components without duplicating effort.

## Impact

The people data model has improved data access and reduced the time analysts spend preparing datasets. It provides a trusted foundation for workforce planning and reporting, helping ensure the MoJ is better equipped to manage staffing challenges, support employee wellbeing, and measure the impact of internal programmes.

The model also enables new types of analysis that were previously out of reach due to inconsistent or inaccessible data.

## Tools & Technologies

We used modern data engineering tools and pipelines to model and join datasets into a unified structure. The platform is designed for flexibility and scalability and supports downstream tools for dashboards, reporting, and advanced analytics.

## Partners

This work was delivered by the Data Engineering and People Analytics teams, in partnership with analysts and stakeholders across MoJ HR and Strategy functions.
