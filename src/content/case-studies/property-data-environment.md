## Overview

The Property Data Environment project provides a single source of truth for MoJ’s extensive property portfolio, which includes over 1,200 buildings with a combined value of more than £35 billion. By automating data extraction and creating a structured reporting environment, the initiative improves transparency, reduces risk, and supports operational and strategic decisions.

## Challenge

Property data was fragmented across internal systems and third-party suppliers, often requiring manual updates and reconciliation. This made it difficult to track running costs, utilisation, and compliance across the estate. Delays in reporting and lack of consistency posed risks to financial oversight and operational planning.

## Solution

We developed a scalable Common Data Environment (CDE) that integrates data from SharePoint, APIs, and other cloud-based sources. The system automates the extraction, transformation, and validation of property data, ensuring that reports are accurate, timely, and easy to interpret.

The CDE supports both operational and financial use cases, enabling better oversight of property spend, asset performance, and estate planning. It is designed to be reusable and flexible, supporting future transformation across the property directorate and beyond.

## Impact

The automated environment reduces delays and avoids overspend by giving property teams access to real-time, trusted data. It enables more accurate forecasting, helps identify underutilised assets, and supports strategic decision-making around estate rationalisation and investment. The solution is already helping to avoid unnecessary costs and improve cross-team coordination.

## Tools & Technologies

We used API integrations, SharePoint automation, and scalable data pipelines to deliver a structured and governed Common Data Environment.

## Partners

This work was delivered by the Property Directorate in collaboration with MoJ Data Engineering and Estates Operations teams.
