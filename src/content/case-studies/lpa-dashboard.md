## Overview

The Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) Dashboard provides near real-time access to key operational and performance data for the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). It is powered by a centralised data warehouse that consolidates business logic and enables consistent reporting across OPG and wider MoJ.

## Challenge

Prior to the dashboard’s launch, OPG reporting relied on dispersed data sources, manual processing, and duplicated business logic. Reports were inconsistent and infrequent, limiting the ability to monitor performance or respond to emerging trends. There was no unified system for tracking LPA applications across services and stages.

## Solution

We developed a conformed data warehouse that integrates LPA-related data from across the organisation, with embedded logic reviewed and agreed with analysts and operational stakeholders. The dashboard draws directly from this warehouse, ensuring that all outputs are aligned and trustworthy.

It includes metrics on application volumes, timeliness, decision points, and service performance, and allows users to drill into data by channel, region, or time period. It also supports comparisons between legacy and modernised services, helping track transformation progress.

## Impact

The dashboard improved reporting frequency, reduced the time analysts spend preparing data, and enabled faster, clearer operational insights. It increased confidence in metrics and enabled both internal and external users to understand LPA service performance in real time. This supports continuous improvement and helps ensure that OPG services remain accountable and user-focused.

The underlying warehouse also provides the foundation for additional reporting products, including statutory outputs and internal KPIs.

## Tools & Technologies

The solution uses cloud-based infrastructure, conformed data models, and dashboarding tools integrated with the central OPG data warehouse. Access is governed and documented to ensure consistency and compliance.

## Partners

This work was delivered by MoJ Data Engineering in collaboration with OPG analysts, operational teams, and the LPA service transformation programme.
