## Overview

The Corporate Finance Insight initiative focused on automating and standardising financial reporting across the Ministry of Justice. The goal was to reduce the manual effort required to generate reports, increase the consistency of outputs, and enable analysts to deliver more valuable insights.

## Challenge

Finance teams across the MoJ were spending significant time producing reports using inconsistent, manual processes. A team of 12.5 full-time equivalents (FTE) supported around 57 users, with no single source of truth for financial data. This made it difficult to scale, introduced risks of human error, and limited opportunities to modernise reporting practices.

## Solution

We developed and deployed a centralised financial data model, replacing bespoke solutions with standard templates and automated pipelines. This model provided a single, authoritative source for financial reporting, which could be reused across multiple business units and tools.

We aligned reporting across MoJ departments—including HMPPS, HMCTS, LAA, and others—ensuring a consistent experience and shared understanding of key metrics. The solution was designed to be scalable, auditable, and efficient, making it easier to support ongoing finance strategy development.

## Impact

The new approach freed up 3.5 FTEs and is projected to save £1.5 million over five years. It improved productivity for Finance Controllers by 35% and gave leadership teams faster, more reliable access to the financial insights they needed. Reporting is now more transparent, easier to maintain, and better aligned across MoJ’s business areas.

## Tools & Technologies

We used modern data engineering tools to create a scalable financial data model, supported by automated pipeline orchestration and centralised reporting templates.

## Partners

This work was delivered in collaboration with the MoJ Finance Team and colleagues across business areas including HMPPS, HMCTS, LAA, OPG, CICA, and Justice Digital.
