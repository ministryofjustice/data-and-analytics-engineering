## Overview

NOMIS is one of the Ministry of Justice’s largest and most complex data pipelines, supporting critical analysis and reporting on prison operations. This modernisation project dramatically improved its performance and reliability, unlocking new efficiencies and strengthening data delivery across the organisation.

## Challenge

The original NOMIS pipeline was slow, difficult to maintain, and increasingly unsuited to the growing scale and frequency of data usage. Processing took up to 12 hours each day, causing delays for analysts and limiting the ability to respond to operational needs. Any failure or delay in the pipeline had a knock-on effect for multiple dependent services.

## Solution

We rebuilt the NOMIS data pipeline using a modern, modular architecture that is more scalable and resilient. Key transformations were redesigned to be more efficient, and we introduced robust monitoring to identify and resolve issues quickly.

Processing time was reduced from 12 hours to just 3 hours per day, and the new pipeline supports automatic retries and alerting in case of failures. We also streamlined the logic to reduce technical debt and ensure future adaptability.

## Impact

The new pipeline saves around 2,160 hours of processing time annually—equivalent to 288 working days. With over 2,000 users relying on data powered by NOMIS, this improvement translates to an estimated £5.4 million in annual value through time saved and improved reliability.

It also improved data quality and strengthened confidence in daily reporting, enabling more timely decisions across prison operations, policy, and performance teams.

## Tools & Technologies

We used cloud-native tools, modular orchestration frameworks, and performance monitoring solutions to modernise the pipeline and reduce technical risk.

## Partners

This work was delivered by MoJ Data Engineers in collaboration with prison operations, policy analysts, and data consumers across the justice system.
