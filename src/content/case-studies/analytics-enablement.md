## Overview

The Analytics Enablement initiative was created to help analysts across the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) adopt modern, modelled data pipelines. It focused on bridging the gap between engineering and analysis by embedding capability, providing training, and introducing tools to support analysts in working with structured data.

## Challenge

While the MoJ had invested in building high-quality, automated data pipelines, many analysts continued to rely on ad hoc extracts and manual processes. This limited the value of the new infrastructure and created inefficiencies in analysis and reporting. Analysts needed clearer support to transition to modelled data and take full advantage of the underlying architecture.

## Solution

We established a dedicated enablement function to support adoption. This included embedding Analytics Engineers in key analytical teams to act as hands-on guides for working with modelled data. We also delivered training programmes and developed tools to make model navigation, querying, and documentation easier.

In parallel, we developed resourcing models to scale this support, including an innovative apprenticeship programme that placed trainees directly into teams. This created capacity while fostering a common approach to best practices and reusability across domains.

## Impact

The initiative improved the consistency and quality of analysis across MoJ by increasing adoption of modelled data. Analysts reported greater confidence in data sources and fewer hours spent preparing inputs for their work. The embedded model also strengthened collaboration between engineering and analytical professions and helped scale knowledge across the organisation.

It also laid the foundation for future improvements in analytics capability, data literacy, and product reuseâ€”creating a more efficient and aligned analytical community.

## Tools & Technologies

We delivered tailored training content, model documentation tools, query builders, and pattern libraries to support transition. Embedded engineers worked alongside analysts using shared version control and codebases.

## Partners

This work was delivered by the Data Engineering and Analytics communities, in partnership with domain-specific analyst teams across justice services.
