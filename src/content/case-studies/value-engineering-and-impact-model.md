## Overview

The Value Engineering and Impact Model enables the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to measure the return on investment (ROI) of data initiatives and prioritise projects based on expected benefits. By quantifying impact using a consistent methodology, the model supports better planning, stronger business cases, and more strategic use of data and digital capability.

## Challenge

While MoJ teams were delivering valuable data products and services, there was no formal way to consistently estimate or compare their impact. Without this, it was difficult to assess the full benefit of engineering work, justify investment, or choose between competing priorities. A lack of visibility also made it harder to engage senior stakeholders and track long-term progress.

## Solution

We developed a structured value model that estimates the financial and non-financial benefits of data initiatives. It calculates expected impact based on metrics such as number of queries, time saved per query, and average staff cost. This data-driven approach allows us to estimate ROI, payback period, and opportunity cost.

The model is integrated into the way projects are scoped and reviewed. It also supports forward planning by helping identify areas where investment in data infrastructure could deliver the greatest return.

## Impact

The value model has become a core component of the MoJâ€™s data strategy. It helps teams demonstrate the case for change, communicate impact to decision-makers, and prioritise initiatives that deliver high public value. It has been applied to projects across domains, from policy dashboards to operational automation.

## Tools & Technologies

We use data logs, user tracking, and estimation templates alongside standard value modelling logic to calculate and visualise impact. The model is maintained and reviewed by the Value Engineering Office.

## Partners

This work was led by the Office of the Chief Data Officer in collaboration with data engineers, product managers, analysts, and domain leads across the department.
