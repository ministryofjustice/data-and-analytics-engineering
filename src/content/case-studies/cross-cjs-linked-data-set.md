## Overview

The Cross-CJS Data Linking initiative enables end-to-end analysis of case journeys, offender pathways, and victim outcomes by integrating data from the Police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and Ministry of Justice. It provides a shared evidence base to support better decisions, services, and outcomes across the Criminal Justice System.

## Challenge

Justice data was historically fragmented across organisational boundaries. Analysts and policy teams lacked the ability to track a case or person from arrest to final outcome. This made it difficult to assess where people disengage from the system, how different interventions affect outcomes, or how to improve services for vulnerable groups.

## Solution

We developed secure, de-identified pipelines to link person and case-level data across the justice system. The resulting dataset was designed to support a wide range of analytical use cases—from operational dashboards to academic research—while maintaining rigorous data governance and privacy standards.

The dataset enables analysts to follow victims, defendants, and cases through the entire justice process. It also integrates with other tools, such as the Victim Attrition Dashboard, to provide deeper insights into user journeys and system performance.

## Impact

The linked dataset allows analysts and policymakers to explore critical questions such as: where in the process do victims disengage? What are the pathways of repeat offenders? How effective are different interventions?

It has already informed justice policy, supported consultation on the Victims and Prisoners Act, and enabled novel research collaborations. The work improves not just insight generation, but also the quality, transparency, and usability of MoJ data.

## Tools & Technologies

We used de-identified linking, secure data pipelines, and cloud-based governance tooling to enable cross-agency analysis. The dataset is structured to support repeatable, scalable research and operational use.

## Partners

This work was delivered in collaboration with the Police, Crown Prosecution Service, MoJ data engineers and analysts, and academic researchers supported by ADR UK and the Office for National Statistics.
