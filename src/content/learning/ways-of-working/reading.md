## Reading Groups

Starting your own or joining a Data and Analytic Engineering team reading group can significantly enhance your learning experience by combining the intellectual stimulation of reading with the social benefits of group interaction. 

Whether your goal is to deepen your understanding of a subject, improve your communication skills, or simply enjoy the company of fellow readers, a reading group offers a supportive and enriching environment to achieve these objectives.

### Our reading groups in progress: 

* The Data Analytics and Engineering Reading Group covers the book [The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Definitive-Dimensional/dp/1118530802) by the Kimball Group.

   Although this group is in progress if youâ€™d like to run the next one please contact a Lead Analytics Engineer for more details.

* The Design Patterns Reading Group aims to teach and understand the wide variety of software engineering design patterns. This can aid in understanding and discussion during software engineering projects.

   To find out more join #design-patterns on slack.
