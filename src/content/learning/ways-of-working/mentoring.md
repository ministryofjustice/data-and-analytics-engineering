Take advantage of structured personal growth and development through our mentoring scheme.

The Data & Analysis Directorate Mentoring Scheme is for those who have not yet signed-up yet and are interested in being paired with a mentor or mentee, we have introduced a new registration method via [Microsoft Forms - sign-up here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KEeHxuZx_kGp4S6MNndq2GNlcdp1FLNBr4zg-7i80opUNkJFMUhJN0tXQTlRRzNRVDI5OENZV09TWS4u). This streamlined process will ensure we collect all relevant information and continue to match mentors and mentees effectively.

Now is an excellent time to sign up as a mentor. We currently have a high demand for mentors, especially at grades SEO level and above.

Please note that if you are already enrolled in the scheme, there is no need to re-register using this form unless you wish to be re-matched.

For mentees who have previously signed up via our email and are awaiting a match, please rest assured that you are on our waiting list. We will pair you with a suitable mentor as soon as one becomes available.
