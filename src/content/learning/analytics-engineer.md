## Analytics Engineer

Analytics engineering at the MoJ bridges the gap between data engineers and data analysts by ensuring that high-quality, well-structured data is available for analysis and reporting. 
We focus on transforming raw data into organised, usable formats through data modelling, testing, and automation, enabling analysts and decision-makers to derive actionable insights efficiently. 

Our work ensures the seamless flow of data, from its raw state to dashboards and reports that inform policy and decision-making across the department.

When you join you’ll be given access to our [operational onboarding Trello  for Data and Analytics Engineers](https://trello.com/b/AxQfkv5D/onboarding-data-and-analytics-engineering). It’s a structured process that helps new hires transition smoothly into their roles during their first six months.

## Core Technical Skills for an Analytics Engineer at the MoJ
### Languages
* **SQL:** Essential for querying and transforming data, SQL is used extensively to create clean, well-structured datasets.
* **Python / R:** Python and R are used for data manipulation, automating workflows, and running more advanced analytics tasks, particularly in R-Studio.
### Creating the Data Model Brief and Blueprint
* **[Kimball Resources](https://www.kimballgroup.com/):** Proficiency in Kimball’s dimensional modelling concepts to design robust, scalable data models.
* **Database Relationship Diagrams:** Ability to use tools that visually map out the relationships between different tables and databases to ensure a clear structure for data analysis with tools like dbdiagram.io, diagrams.net, draw.io.
* **Create-A-Derived-Table:** Expertise in building derived tables to transform raw data into meaningful, ready-to-use datasets for analysis.
* **Database Tool Learning (dbt):** Hands-on experience with dbt (data build tool) for building modular and reusable data transformations.

### Building the Data Model Environment and Deployment
* **R-Studio:** Familiarity with R-Studio for data analysis and environment management, particularly in the deployment and automation of analytics workflows.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control expertise for managing data models and code, ensuring collaboration, traceability, and proper deployment of changes.
* **Athena and the [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/):** Knowledge of Amazon Athena, a key tool used at MoJ for querying large datasets, often within the MoJ’s Analytical Platform.
* **Macros:** Understanding and usage of macros to automate repetitive tasks in data processing.

### Data Model Testing
* **AWS Console & Athena Tables:** Proficiency in working with AWS services, particularly querying and testing Athena tables for accuracy and performance.
* **SQL Code:** Writing and testing SQL code to ensure data transformations and models work as expected.
* **dbt Commands:** Using dbt commands to test, build, and validate data models, ensuring high-quality outputs.
* **GitHub Actions:** Automating testing and deployment processes using GitHub Actions, ensuring that changes are tested and verified before deployment.
* **Lint Code:** Implementing linting tools to ensure clean, maintainable, and error-free code.

### Production Ready Assurance
* **Amazon Athena Editor:** Experience in using Athena’s SQL editor to test and validate queries before moving them into production.
* **R-Studio Terminal:** Using the terminal in R-Studio to execute commands and manage the analytics environment.
* **GitHub Actions:** Ensuring that data models and transformations are production-ready by using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
* **Linting:** Implementing linting processes for code quality assurance before production deployment.
* **Power BI Dashboards:** Creating and maintaining production-ready dashboards in Power BI, ensuring they are reliable and up-to-date for end users.

By mastering these technical skills, an Analytics Engineer at the MoJ can ensure efficient data workflows, high-quality data models, and reliable reporting that supports the ministry's operational and strategic objectives.
