A Data Engineer at the Ministry of Justice plays a vital role in building and maintaining the infrastructure and systems that support data-driven decision-making across the organisation. 

When you join you’ll be given access to our [operational onboarding Trello  for Data and Analytics Engineers](https://trello.com/b/AxQfkv5D/onboarding-data-and-analytics-engineering). It’s a structured process that helps new hires transition smoothly into their roles during their first six months. 

To excel in this role, a Data Engineer should also develop a range of technical, analytical, and soft skills that align with the MoJ’s data and analytics needs.

## Core technical Data Engineering skills to focus on:


### **Languages**
- **Python**: A fundamental language for building data pipelines, processing data, and automating workflows. It’s widely used for scripting ETL processes and working with big data frameworks.
- **SQL**: Essential for querying and managing relational databases, especially when dealing with structured data and performing data transformations.
- **Bash/Shell Scripting**: Useful for task automation and system management, especially in a Unix/Linux environment.
- **Scala/Java**: Beneficial for working with big data technologies like Apache Spark or Hadoop.

### **Cloud / Amazon Web Services**
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Familiarity with cloud infrastructure is critical. Key AWS services include:
  - **S3**: For scalable data storage.
  - **Redshift**: For data warehousing and large-scale analytics.
  - **RDS**: For managing relational databases in the cloud.
  - **Lambda**: Serverless computing for automating data pipelines.
  - **Glue**: For building and managing ETL jobs.
- **Azure / Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Knowledge of other cloud platforms can be beneficial, as the MoJ may leverage multi-cloud strategies.

### **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins**: Experience with these CI/CD tools is essential to automate the testing, integration, and deployment of data pipelines, ensuring that changes are rolled out efficiently and without breaking existing systems.
- **Terraform / CloudFormation**: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools used to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources, crucial for building scalable and repeatable data infrastructure.

### **Testing**
- **Unit Testing / Integration Testing**: Critical for ensuring the correctness of data pipelines and transformations, testing is an integral part of building reliable data workflows.
- **Data Validation**: Automated checks to ensure data quality, including handling missing data, schema validation, and integrity checks, to ensure that processed data is accurate and meets organizational standards.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: A best practice to develop robust and error-free data pipelines by writing tests before the actual code.

### **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
- **Apache Airflow / AWS Glue**: Proficiency in ETL tools to design and manage pipelines that extract data from various sources, transform it to meet the organization’s needs, and load it into data warehouses or other systems.
- **Custom ETL Pipelines**: Building custom ETL processes using Python and SQL, particularly for complex data transformations and cleaning tasks.
- **Data Wrangling**: Expertise in transforming raw data into usable formats for analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

### **Orchestration**
- **Apache Airflow**: A key orchestration tool for scheduling, monitoring, and managing workflows, ensuring that data pipelines run efficiently and on time.
- **Step Functions (AWS)**: For building complex workflows and ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct sequence across multiple services and environments.

### **Architecture**
- **Data Warehousing**: Understanding of data warehouse design, with tools like **AWS Redshift**, to store and query large datasets efficiently.
- **Data Lakes**: Familiarity with setting up and managing data lakes, like **AWS S3**, for unstructured and semi-structured data storage.
- **Scalable Data Pipelines**: Experience in designing and building data pipelines that scale with increasing data volumes and organizational demands.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Understanding of how microservices-based systems work, allowing for modular and scalable data engineering solutions.

### **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Transformer Models (e.g., GPT)**: Familiarity with large language models and their applications in processing and analyzing text data, which may be useful for projects involving Natural Language Processing (NLP) within the justice system.
- **Fine-Tuning LLMs**: Skills in fine-tuning pre-trained language models for domain-specific tasks such as text classification, entity recognition, or legal document analysis.
- **AI Ethics and Governance**: Understanding the ethical implications and governance of using AI, especially in public-sector applications, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards.

By building expertise in these areas, a Data Engineer at the Ministry of Justice will be well-equipped to design and manage efficient, secure, and scalable data systems that support the MoJ’s mission of delivering data-driven insights and improvements to the justice system.
