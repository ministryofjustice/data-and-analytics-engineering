The Ministry of Justice Analytics Engineer 18-Week Apprenticeship is designed to provide apprentices with a solid foundation in key data engineering and analytics skills before they transition to on-the-job training. It is part of the Data Analyst Level 4 Apprenticeship program, which includes comprehensive training on essential tools and technologies used in the field.

## Key Topics Covered During the Apprenticeship:


* **SQL and Databases:** Apprentices learn how to create, query, and manage databases using SQL, one of the most critical skills for data analysis.


* **Programming for Data Analysis:** Training includes programming languages such as Python and R, both of which are widely used for data manipulation and analysis.


* **Data Warehousing and Data Modelling:** This covers the design and population of star schemas, as well as working with data warehouses.


* **Data Preparation and Visualisation:** Skills in using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and other business intelligence platforms are developed to help visualise data effectively.


* **Machine Learning and Data Science:** An introduction to machine learning and how it integrates with cloud platforms such as Azure or AWS.


* **Version Control:** Tools such as Git for managing data projects and collaboration.



## Analytics Engineer 10 Week Boot Camp

The Analytics Engineer ten-week bootcamp is part of the eighteen month Apprenticeship and is front-loaded, meaning the first 10 weeks are focused intensively on theoretical and practical learning, which provides participants with hands-on experience that they can apply once they join their teams.

### Benefits of the Bootcamp:


* **Hands-on Learning:** Apprentices work on real-world projects and scenarios, making them job-ready upon completion.


* **Mentorship and Support:** Learners are supported by a mentor and a Digital Learning Consultant (DLC) who help them track their progress and ensure they are on course to complete the apprenticeship successfully.


* **Blended Learning:** The program uses a combination of remote and online courses to provide flexibility while maintaining engagement through interactive projects and real-world applications.

Following the Apprenticeship, apprentices continue learning on the job for the remaining duration of the 18-months, with continuous mentorship (double check with Ian) and formal assessments to help solidify their skills.


Learners will learn to use tools such as PowerBI. SQL Server, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Python and R programming languages, and Cloud Technologies such as: Azure, AWS, GCP.
