Our buddy system is a structured approach where a new or less experienced team member is paired with an experienced colleague (the "buddy") to help them transition into the team, understand the work culture, and get up to speed on technical and operational practices to help people get settled in. 

The buddy system can even help experienced members of staff moving from other professions (e.g. from data science into data engineering) who may require some advice on getting set up in new technology.

## Key Aspects of the Buddy System:


### Onboarding Support:

The buddy helps the new hire understand the team's workflow, coding standards, tools, and development practices. This includes explaining the engineering team's processes (like code reviews, deployments, etc.) and giving guidance on day-to-day tasks.

### Knowledge Transfer:

Buddies share knowledge about the team's projects, ongoing challenges, and system architecture, ensuring the new hire can contribute effectively and understand the broader scope of work.

### Social Integration:

The buddy also helps the new hire integrate socially into the team, introducing them to colleagues, team rituals, and communication dynamics. This helps the new member feel welcome and comfortable in the team environment.

### Problem-Solving Guidance:

The buddy can serve as the first point of contact for technical queries or roadblocks, helping the new engineer troubleshoot problems or navigate the team's resources more efficiently.

### Building Team Culture:

By pairing people up, the buddy system can reinforce a collaborative culture, promote knowledge sharing, and strengthen team bonds.

### Benefits of a Buddy System:

* Faster Ramp-Up: New engineers become productive more quickly with hands-on, real-time guidance from their buddy.
* Retention: A strong buddy system can lead to better retention rates by providing support and helping the new member feel part of the team.
* Knowledge Retention: It helps distribute key technical and project knowledge across the team, reducing the impact of siloed expertise.
* Team Cohesion: It promotes stronger interpersonal relationships within the team and fosters a sense of camaraderie.
