Our [code reviews](https://gds-way.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/manuals/code-review-guidelines.html) ensure code quality while promoting learning and knowledge sharing amongst the team.

Itâ€™s a collaborative process where we examine each other's code to ensure quality, correctness, and adherence to coding standards before it becomes part of the main codebase. 

This practice is integral to modern software development and is used to identify bugs, improve code quality, and facilitate knowledge sharing among team members.
