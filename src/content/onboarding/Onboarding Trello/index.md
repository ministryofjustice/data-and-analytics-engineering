The [operational onboarding Trello board for Data and Analytics Engineers](https://trello.com/b/AxQfkv5D/onboarding-data-and-analytics-engineering) is a structured tool that helps new hires transition smoothly into their roles during their first six months. This board organises tasks, milestones, training, and project assignments across multiple phases of onboarding. Here's an overview:

1. Welcome and Buddy System
2. Tools and Services Set-up
3. Training and Learning
4. Project Involvement
5. Evaluation and Feedback

You should be given access to the Trello board at the beginning of your onboarding process, ideally:

Before or on your first day: This allows you to familiarise yourself with the structure, expectations, and key tasks youâ€™ll be working on over the next few months. Having the board early ensures you're prepared and aware of upcoming steps.
